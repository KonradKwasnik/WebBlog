  <XL>Why?</XL>
  <M>
    Sometimes you want to render component outside <B>div</B> with{" "}
    <B>id="root"</B>. It may happen when you're working on some component that
    uses <B>z-index</B> or <B>absolute/fixed/static</B> positions in css. These
    could be modals, alerts or prompts.
  </M>
  <M>
    This can be achieved by usage of <B>React.createPortal()</B>. Honestly,
    using this API everywhere and copying the logic breaks the rule -{" "}
    <B>don't repeat yourself</B>. That's why it's a good idea to create a hook
    that will contain this logic and reduce the amount of duplicated code.

    Now to use the portal you can use a shortened version. Here we used two
    design patterns - <B>facade</B> and <B>factory method</B>.
