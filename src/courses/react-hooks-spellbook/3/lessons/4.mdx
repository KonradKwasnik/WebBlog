  <XL>Why?</XL>
  <M>
    Let's say you have a great homepage with fancy looking animation - you're
    animating the{" "}
    <A href="https://greenonsoftware.com/" outside>
      black hole
    </A>{" "}
    inside <B>canvas</B>. It's good to animate it only when users actually see
    it. So you could detect whether the user is seeing the section with the
    animation and based on that, turn it on or off.
  </M>

  />
  <M>
    The browser have a dedicated API for that called <B>IntersectionObserver</B>.
    When writing in <B>React</B>, it's a good idea to create a proper hook to handle
    such logic for your own convenience and the ability to use it in every component.
  </M>

  <XL>Usage</XL>
  <M>
    This is how we will use our <B>useIntersectionObserver</B> hook.{" "}
  </M>
  <Snippet description="An example of use">{`
 // The visible flag will change if the div will have 40% visibility.
const { visible, ref } = useIntersectionObserver<HTMLDivElement>({ treshhold: 0.4 });
  
return (
  <>
   {/*We pass ref to element we want to observe.*/}
    <div ref={ref} style={{ minHeight: '100vh' }}>
      Your main homepage section.
    </div>
    <div style={{ minHeight: '100vh' }}>
      Other home page content.
    </div>
    <div>{visible ? 'Main homepage section is visible' : ''}</div>
  </>
)`}</Snippet>

  <M>
    First, let's create interfaces. They will define what our hook will accept
    and what will return.

  />
  <M>
    Now it's time to implement the <B>useIntersectionObserver</B> hook itself.
    We have interfaces so we know how it should more or less work.
  </M>

  />
  <M>
    Hook cannot be used on the server side - so we block this option at the very
    beginning.
  </M>
  <M>
    In addition, if the native <B>IntersectionObserver</B> API is not supported
    then our code will not work either. So we do not run it and log an error for
    the developer.
  </M>
  <M>
    Next, we create an <B>IntersectionObserver</B> object, we pass callback and
    configuration object.

  <M>We need to add tests that allow us to do refactors later.</M>
