description: The nomenclature must be consistent and clear throughout the solution, so we must take care of this from the beginning.

  <M>
    It will be very simple. Let's use one and the same form, let's avoid
    superfluous words. The description must reflect what we are testing, and
    let's not repeat phrases. Look at the following examples to understand the
    point.
  </M>
  <Snippet>
    {`
describe("Pizza meets standards when: ", () => { üëç
  it("size is between 30-40 cm", () => {}); üëç
 
  it("cake is brown", () => {}); üëç
 
  it("cheese is melted", () => {}); üëç
   
  it("cake is warm", () => {}); üëç
   
  it("plate is clean", () => {}); üëç
});
    `}
  </Snippet>
  <M>In the above example, we keep an eye on the following rules: </M>
  <List items="We should use only the Past Simple,Sentences in describe blocks should begin with a capital letter,Sentences in describe blocks should be short and begin with lowercase letters,The sentences in the it blocks should be very short, The sentence at the end of describe ends with : and space" />
  <M>
    You will see later how nicely it looks when you display the result of the
    tests.
