description: We will divide the tests based on certain predicates and determine what types of tests exists.

<Section>
  <XL>Division by area</XL>
  <M>
    Taking into account the area we are testing, the test can be divided into
    the following types:{" "}
  </M>
  <List items="Unit tests, Integration tests, E2e tests" />
  <M>
    <B>Unit tests</B> are fast and precise. You've seen such tests before. In
    them, you are focused on a specific thing. In the context of a restaurant,
    it will be cutting with a knife.
  </M>
  <Snippet>
    {`
// These are just unit tests.
describe("Pizza meets standards when: ", () => {
  it("size is between 30-40 cm", () => {});
 
  it("cake is brown", () => {});
 
  it("cheese is melted", () => {});
   
  it("cake is warm", () => {});
   
  it("plate is clean", () => {});
});
    `}
  </Snippet>
  <M>
    <B>Integration tests</B> verify communication. An example of such a test in
    the context of a restaurant would be the verification of how the cook learns
    to make pizza. We could verify that the knowledge transferred comes from
    books and that's all. Nothing concrete. These tests are fairly quick and can
    cover many aspects.
  </M>
  <Snippet>
    {`
// These are integration tests.
describe("Chef uses the book to teach others when: ", () => {
    it("pizza recipe is used from page 31", () => {});
    it("person who is learning is not stressed", () => {});
});
    `}
  </Snippet>
  <M>
    <B>E2e tests</B> are slow and usually very long. In the context of our
    restaurant, this would be a test to see if the pizza is good without going
    into details. In this test, we check through a real example. Not the chef
    tastes the pizza, but the customer, and based on his opinion we determine
    the result of the test.
  </M>
  <Snippet>
    {`
// These are e2e tests.
describe("Restaurant generates profits when: ", () => {
    it("we sell more than 100 pizzas per month", () => {});
    it("there is no loss generated by employees", () => {});
});
    `}
  </Snippet>
  <M>
    You'll see more differences when you start implementing them. Right now, the
    only differences are description and context. Relax, you will start coding
    soon.
