  <XL>Definition</XL>
  <M>
    A test is a <B>verification of something</B>. Such verification can give
    different answers. It can be finite - <B>yes</B> or <B>no</B>, or infinite -{" "}
    <B>value of PI</B>.
  </M>
  <M>
    The test can also be seen as defining answers to specific questions. For
    example, the question of whether <B>2+2=4</B> is a test. It's a bit of an
    abstract concept and, like many things in software development, requires
    some flair.

    As I mentioned earlier, some of these tests are finite, and some are not. It
    is up to us as engineers to determine the level of precision we expect in a
    given situation. The greater the precision - the smaller the area to be
    verified.

    Sometimes we are forced to write infinite tests. We cannot answer the
    question about exact value of <B>PI</B> number.
