    Imagine a situation in which you're talking with <B>AI</B> that can explain
    you everything. Your role is just to write simple and precise question. The
    quality of response is based on question complexity.

    In software development one of the most important soft skill is creating a
    right questions. It follows <B>google search</B>, <B>chat GPT</B> and even
    working with clients. Without good question, you're not able to do your
    work.

    Questions are root of testing. Before you start testing you need to ask
    questions. You cannot go and just try to click random stuff in application,
    you're not able to determine is the dedicated behavior valid or not. So, you
    need to ask questions, questions and I will repeat it again <B>questions</B>.
  </M>

    This may looks easy but believe me - it's not. I met a lot of managers,
    developers and other proffesion which cannot ask others correctly. Also I
    have problems with that, especially if topic is complex or I don't have
    required knowledge to raise a question.

  <XL>Good question</XL>
  <M>
    It's simple and concrette, it covers one topic. These are correct ones:
    questions:
  </M>
  <List items="Should 2+2 equal to 4?,Is BMW a car model?,What color should this button have?" />
  <M>
    For each of these we can easy answer. Also these questions resolves all
    doubts. For example if we ask about concrette color of button, we don't need
    ask never again about this color.

<Section>
  <XL>Bad question</XL>
  <M>
    It's often too complex and covers more that one topic. These are incorrect
    ones:
  </M>
  <List items="Is 2+2=4 and 3+3=6?,Is BMW a car model produced in Germany?,Is that button color correct?" />
  <M>
    First one covers more than one result, same as second one. Last one is too
    generic. We don't know what the "correct" means. It can be any color.
