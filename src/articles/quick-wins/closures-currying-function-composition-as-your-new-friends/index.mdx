  <XL>Prelude</XL>
  <M>
    When writing functional code, we can get the impression that it is very
    difficult to understand. I have to agree with that. However, such code also
    has many interesting features that can be used in everyday work. Once we
    have mastered the basics, we will begin to notice how powerful this tool is.

  <XL>1. Looking at not pure function</XL>
  <M>
    This function is not pure because it has side effects, modifies a variable
    outside scope, returns different values ​​each time and modifies input
    parameters.
  </M>
  <Code description="Not a pure function">

  </Code>

<Section>
  <XL>2. Pure function</XL>
  <M>
    A pure function always returns the same values ​​for the same arguments,
    does not modify input parameters and has no side effects like asynchronous
    code or changing something outside its range.
  </M>

<Section>
  <XL>3. Function composition</XL>
  <M>
    Its just passing one function result to other functions. Great composition
    is always implemented with pure functions.
  </M>

</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>4. Closure</XL>
  <M>
    A closure occurs when a function returns another function, and this function
    may use the value contained in the "parent" function.
  </M>

<Section>
  <XL>5. Currying</XL>
  <M>
    In simple words, transforming one multi-argument function to many unary
    functions. We can do it ourselves or write a function to do it for us.
  </M>

<Summary>
  <M>
    I hope the basics of functional programming are now easy for you. Play with
    an example because practice is necessary to understand it completely and to
    notice the benefits from functional programming.
