  <XL>Why ?</XL>
  <M>
    In languages like C# we have classes like Collection, List. They offer
    typesafety and a lot of usefull methods. Goal of this is to have same
    consistent way of handling arrays in application via one implementation. Why
    things like creating own abstraction are usefull? Imagine situation where
    you creating components via map function in React. Always as developer you
    must remember to add id to every element - which must be unique. With
    abstraction we can guarantee that and remove additional thinkinh from
    developer.

  <M>
    Before we start implementation we should design our methods, properties in
    interface which will be implemented by List class.
