title: Improving code that was not written by us

<Section>
  <XL>Prelude</XL>
  <M>
    When writing a project with your colleagues, you write some functionality.
    You will notice that there are many places in the project where you can use
    the Array prototype methods like map, reduce.
  </M>
  <M>
    Together you come to the conclusion that this prototype lacks some useful
    methods like contains, swap. In addition, some of the built-in methods are
    mutable, which interferes with React library, and there are many anonymous
    functions in the project, which you must try to understand anyway.
  </M>
  <M hasBg>
    We will implement the List class using the facade pattern to create a
    unified API for our developers.
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>1. API design</XL>
  <M>
    We want our List class to have additional functionality - tracking a
    specific list item and reading this item at any time.
  </M>
  <M>
    In addition, we need a method that will allow us to replace a specific
    element.
  </M>

  <XL>2. Mock implementation</XL>
  <M>
    Lets create class which implements previously created interface. In TDD,
    making throwing exceptions is standard practice to indicate that they are
    not yet implemented.
  </M>
  <Code description="Fake implementation for TypeScript peace of mind :)">
    <deckgo-highlight-code src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polubis/Creating-list-abstraction-for-arrays/main/src/snippets/2_Mock_implementation.ts"></deckgo-highlight-code>
  </Code>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>3. Creation of test scenarios</XL>
  <M>
    Before starting the implementation, we think about exactly how our methods
    should behave. We write descriptions of what we will test. Thanks to this
    approach, as a rule, it is possible to locate more edge cases in the code.
  </M>

<Section>
  <XL>4. Implementing tests</XL>
  <M>
    Time for tests implementation. After this step, all tests are red. We
    created some helper function and test user data which you can check inside
    mocks directory.
  </M>
  <Code description="Several tests written in jest">

<Section>
  <XL>5. Making tests green</XL>
  <M>
    Having the correct implementation, we can go to refactor later. In this
    article we skip this step.
  </M>
  <M>
    In the constructor, we assign initial values ​​and set the pointer. Then we
    implement specific methods that will move the pointer and return a new
    instance of the List. Additionally, we add a method to replace an element
    with an identifier or a pointer / index.

  <XL>6. Usage in React</XL>
  <M>
    No spread operators, anonymous functions for data management, 100%
    immutability, separation of concerns, encapsulation and readable code as
    benefits of facade pattern.
  </M>

<Summary>
  <M>
    I hope you enjoyed this quick win :). Ofcourse this is simple example but as
    you see sky is the limit and you can create your own facade for everything
    in your application.
