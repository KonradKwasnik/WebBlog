title: Improving SEO with Ahrefs
---

<Prelude>
  <M>
    I'm greedy... Instead of hiring someone for SEO, I decided to find a
    ready-made solution. I searched for a while and I used a number of tools.
    After some time, I found that <B>Ahrefs</B> suited me best.
  </M>
  <M>
    All I wanted to accomplish at this point was to generate reports that would
    tell me what I I'm doing wrong and suggest how to improve it. I was sick of
    of reading about it on the internet. If you have had the opportunity to read
    about SEO, then you have certainly reached the same conclusions as I had -{" "}
    <B>THIS IS NOT A SIMPLE AND OBVIOUS TOPIC</B> ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
  </M>
  <Hint hasBg>
    I prefer to change borders in divs and play with some colors like a real
    frontend weirdo.

<Section>
  <XL>1. Why Ahrefs?</XL>
  <M>
    Well... It gives all that I was looking for in a free plan... Reports,
    reports and more reports. On top of that, it gives hints on how to fix
    something and explanations why. It saves both time and educates as well.
  </M>
  <M>
    In addition, if you are the <B>Ricky Rich from USA</B>, you can afford a
    premium package that will make you a <B>Senior SEO analyst</B>.
  </M>
  <M>The reports are very clear. Take a look at the screenshots below:</M>

  <M>
    These beauties come to your email automatically from time to time. This way
    you don't have to refresh the platform like a madman manually. You can
    continue playing games.

    If you're curious take a look at{" "}

  <XL>2. How to get started with Ahrefs?</XL>

    is about.

  <XL>3. Auditing my site with Ahrefs</XL>
  <M>I'm playing "Path of Exile", and the following arrived in my email:</M>
  <Img
    src="/assets/improving-seo-with-ahrefs/ahrefs.jpg"
    description="Notice from Ahrefs"
  />
  <M>
    It shows that I have 0 errors, 50 warnings and 42 suggestions. I don't need
    to worry because I have 0 errors. Errors will always affect the SEO
    negatively so treat them as bugs, like vermin on potatoes.
  </M>
  <M>
    I have a lot of warnings, they may affect SEO negatively, but they don't
    have to. Anyway, let's avoid the risk, it's worth to get rid of them.
  </M>
  <M>
    The last category can be understood as <B>tips and tricks</B>. If you are
    SEO purists and you have the time to do it, then I invite you to play. The
    entertainment is amazing.
  </M>
  <M>
    You can see that compared to the last version of the page I have one less
    warning, so by some miracle I fixed something. Kudos for me.
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>4. Let's analyze the report</XL>
  <M>
    I fired up <B>Ahrefs</B> and started to analyze. It was very simple. All I
    needed to do was click on the first category of the problem.
  </M>
  <Img src="/assets/improving-seo-with-ahrefs/description-link.jpg" />
  <M>
    So I click and it shows me a list of affected sites. Let's take the first
    one that is the home page (the first page in the list).
  </M>
  <Img src="/assets/improving-seo-with-ahrefs/problems.jpg" />
  <M>This is how the summary looks like:</M>
  <Img
    src="/assets/improving-seo-with-ahrefs/home.jpg"
    description="1 warning and 2 suggestions"
  />
  <M>
    The reason for the warning is simple - the page description for the{" "}
    <B>meta</B> tag and the <B>description</B> attribute is to short. Currently
    it's 65 characters, and it should be between 110 and 160. Well, I added a
    dozen of spaces and it's fine üí©. I'm kidding, of course.
  </M>
</Section>

<Section>
  <XL>5. Let's check the fix</XL>
  <M>
    I have corrected the description of the home page, deployment has started,
    and I am going to play "Path of Exile." A few hours later, a report came to
    my email. I could generate it immediately after the deployment, but this is
    only an article so I had time.
  </M>
  <M>
    The new report shows that there is one <B>warning</B> less. So the fix has
    been successful. Almost a hundred more and it will be neat.

<Summary>
  <M>

    will appreciate this tool, especially if it locates real problems such as
    missing page titles or bad formatting of particular attributes. That's a
    free SEO tests that you don't have to maintain.

    SEO needs to be maintained like a car üöó. The way that search engine
    algorithms work is a separate field of science. Much more needs to be done.
    This, unfortunately, is not an area of interest for such a small article.
