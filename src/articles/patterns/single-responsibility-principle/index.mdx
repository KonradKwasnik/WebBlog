title: Single responsibility principle

<Section>
  <XL>What is SRP ?</XL>
  <M>
    SRP refers to single responsibility principle as you probably know. It means
    every module / component / class / function should be responsible only for
    one thing. For example function which calculates sum of two number should
    done only this. Nothing more.
  </M>

<Section>
  <XL>Why we should use SRP ?</XL>
  <M>
    Applying rules, patterns is always good idea, especially in programming.
    Patterns allows developers to work quicker in projects because they are
    decreasing code understanding time, increases scalability of code, makes
    code easier to test and etc...
  </M>
  <M>
    Ofcourse patterns especially from SOLID group are always ok. Just one
    important rule to use. Design, implement first / refactor later. Often
    developers make huge mistake and trying to make their code too "perfect".
  </M>
  <M>
    This ends later with code which is hard to understand and maintain. They key
    is to find balance in applying different patterns in programming. Patterns
    should be used when needed and not when they are to be used for art.

  <XL>Invalid User management feature</XL>
  <M>Check code bellow and try to find problems with current implementation.</M>
  <M>
    As you probably see this code is bad because we creating User object
    instance and also in same class we have{" "}
    <M primary bold>
      loadUser()
    </M>{" "}
    method which handles loading users. Ofcourse in this example loading is
    mocked but in real world this function should load data from DB or other
    server. How this can be improved ?
  </M>

  </Code>

<Section>
  <XL>Correct User management feature</XL>
  <M>
    First of all to improve above code we need to create additional classes
    which will be responsible for one thing. We create{" "}
    <M primary bold>
      UserRepository
    </M>{" "}
    - which contains methods to load User from dedicated source and{" "}
    <M primary bold>
      UserController
    </M>{" "}
    which manages user object state and triggers whole loading procedure. Also
    we created additional type which requires to implement{" "}
    <M primary bold>
      load()
    </M>{" "}
    method. This can be usefull when we would like to create next repositories
    for other entities.
  </M>
  <M>
    We created layers which can separately tested. Also controller don't know
    anything about connection to DB or other server implementation. controller
    just triggers procedure and waits for finish to perform some additional work
    after.
  </M>
  <M>
    Also in same example we injects via constructor created UserRepository
    object. To make this code "perfect" we should change type definition to
    interfaces to rely on interfaces not implementation - this is required by
    Dependency inversion principle which will be described in other article.

<Summary>
  <M>
    I hope right now you know how to use SRP principle properly and when it
    should be used. This article is part of series{" "}
    <M>understanding SOLID properly by examples</M>.
