  <XL>Prelude</XL>
  <M>People often forget something...</M>
  <M>
    Imagine an ancient coffee express. You can control the stages of coffee
    preparation manually and decide when dedicated step should be performed.
  </M>
  <M>
    Express can be destroyed if you press the button at the wrong moment. How do
    you know if now is the right time to start grinding coffee? It is much more
    convenient to have the software (state machine) which handles that.
  </M>

<Section>
  <XL>1. State machine</XL>
  <M>
    The state machine is a mechanism that makes sure that the operations are
    performed in the right order. After all, you can't make coffee if the coffee
    express is not turned on.
  </M>
  <M>
    In image bellow you can see states inside rectangles. Actions which are
    displayed above lines just triggers state change.

  <XL>2. Implementation</XL>
  <M>
    In code state can be reflected via object. In our code we use functions to
    create these objects. This reduces boilerplate and gives good type safety.
  </M>
  <M>
    Transitions from one state to another are implemented by using references to
    other functions in objects. If there will be attempt to change state in
    invalid order - you will get an exception.
  </M>
  <Hint hasBg>
    Function declarations are hoisted. It means we don't need to worry about
    correct order of declarations. This would not be possible with classes or
    function expressions.
  </Hint>

  </Code>

  <XL>3. Black boxing</XL>
  <M>
    Helper function reduces boilerplate and makes whole state machine black
    boxed. It reduces solution flexibility - you want this. After all, the
    coffee express does not start with a state other than Idle.
  </M>

  <XL>4. Example of usage in React</XL>
  <M>
    If you wan't use your state machine, it's good idea to create facade hook to
    expose consistent API / reuse it later in other view. You will have always
    union of possible states because of exhaustiveness checking mechanism from
    TypeScript.

  <XL>5. You can make it generic</XL>
  <M>
    After several attempts, I think it's not worth it. That's because of
    additional complexity which we adding. Decision is on your side.
  </M>
  <Hint hasBg>
    Instead of implementing it from scratch you can use prod ready solution -
    xstate library which gives additional features and adds cool visualization.

<Summary>
  <M>
    After this short adventure, you probably understand what the state machine
    can do for you. Usage of this pattern dramatically improves your code base,
    especially in complex state management.
